## Day 1: Project Setup

### Objective
Set up the SQL project environment and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Tasks Completed
- Created project folder structure (dataset, SQL_QUERIES, screenshots)
- Set up SQL database (hr_project)
- Created tables for HR dataset
- Imported messy dataset into database

### Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Python 3.13.3

### Outcome
Successfully completed project setup. Ready to start data cleaning and analysis from Day 2.

## Day 2: Data Audit (Messiness Detection)

### Objective
Identify data issues across all tables and columns.

### Tasks Completed
Created cleaned tables
Identified NULL and empty values

### Results/Findings
**Employees and performance** table have empty and NULL values


## Day 3: Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values)

### Objective
Clean the dataset by handling missing values across multiple tables.

### Tasks Completed
- Created cleaned versions of tables (employees_clean, departments_clean, performance_clean)
- Converted empty values into NULL for consistency
- Replaced NULL and empty values with appropriate defaults

### Key Learning
- NULL and empty values are different but both need to be handled
- Data should not be cleaned directly in raw tables
- Business rules are important while filling missing values


## Day 4: Data Cleaning (Handling Inconsistent Text)
### Objective
* Clean the dataset by fixing inconsistent text values across columns.

### Tasks Completed
1. Identified inconsistent text formats (e.g., HR, hr, Hr)
2. Standardized text using functions like `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `INITCAP()`
3. Trimmed extra spaces using TRIM()
4. Replaced incorrect spellings and variations
5. Ensured uniform naming conventions across tables

### Key Learning
* Text inconsistency affects grouping and analysis
* Same values with different formats behave as different data
* Standardization is critical before applying aggregations

## Day 5: Data Cleaning (Handling Invalid Values)
### Objective
* Identify and fix logically incorrect or invalid values in the dataset.
### Tasks Completed
1. Detected invalid values (negative salary, invalid age, incorrect ratings)
2. Applied business rules to define valid ranges
3. Replaced incorrect values using client-provided data
4. Ensured no assumption-based fixes were applied
### Key Learning
* Invalid values are not always missing but logically incorrect
* Data should be corrected using trusted sources (client/system)
* Never blindly manipulate values without business context
